Thieves can be different types:
Fighter - does more damage
Thinker - unlocks safe faster
Trickster - goes undetected by guards and civilian (until they harm anyone or similar)
Sparks - disables alarm


The safe can be:
Unlocked - money is safe to take out
Broken - can take money be alarm has been triggered
Destroyed - money is also destroyed (eg. bomb has blown it all up)


Alarm:
Will go off for a certain number of turns before polive arrive - game over


Ideas?:
Find clues to work out safe code - thinker needs less clues to work it out
Tricksters can talk to people to get clues but if they pry too much they may give themselves away
Clues can be passed on to teammates in the same room 
 - if one teammate in a room gets a clue then all in the room get it

Rooms:
factory to create rooms 
num of guards and civilians in each room will be a random int 
clues can be found in some furniture (eventually)
different levels have different number of rooms - will add different rooms too
